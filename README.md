My website is called "We Go Gym".
It's made as a mock website to a semi-small branch of gyms that align to serve a more serious
approach to fitness with an affordable pay table.

My Index/main page holds a parrallax style of structure, using an initial div that has a fixed background position to follow the viewpoint of the user, while inherietly 
holding a negative z-index for patterned later divs that aren't fixed to show a more dynamic UI. 

For my navbar, I had a collection of links and icons with anchors embed:

Starting with links that aren't active (3) :

- Gyms Near Me
- Yoga
- Weight Training

Every other link holds a link to a seperate page, my logo icon links back to the main page and has a transformative prop. on hover that spins 360 degs over 0.9s.

My door icon kicks the user to the login page and on hover has a scale prop. at 1.5.

My parrallax dive one has a hero statement that is descending using </br> and usign the &nbsp; HTML entity to create non-breaking space for a more staircase look.

On that same parallax div, I floated a gif right to even out the spacing used making sure not to disrupt the flow of text and having the gif style mimic resemble the background it was placed upon. 

On the first unfixed div, it contains a form relating to the price of memberships for each tier. Also the form is anchored to the memberships page that goes
more in-depth about what each tier has in it's package. 

At the bottom, I just placed some more 8-bit gifs because I thought they looked funny and looked nice :).



On my class --> weight-training/personal-training
semi-centered divs in relation to where cards are placed in a flex direction on row and evenly space, using a ul to specificy the different specialties of each trainer. 


Login/Signup pages:

using a form , usign the class <mb-3> i created a login/signup form that has different pages for different accounts.

Memberships Page:

In the content section of my parallax div, it nests 3 divs in a flex-direction column floating the img to the opposing side of text, listing mroe specified package benefits
